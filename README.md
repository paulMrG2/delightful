# Delightful

Are you bored and just not feeling it at work? Try Delightful, a Chrome extension that will brighten your day with delights when you complete a task in your project management software.

Inspired by Asana delights failing to work for a while, and since they returned there has been some issues. We do love Asana delights, but we need that little bit more, and not just for Asana.

Sure, it's only a couple of fancy things for now, but it will expand to cover more software triggers and lots of different animations. You'll never know what to expect, but you will get that warm and fuzzy feeling with an extra bit of dopamine when you deserve it the most.

_A little delight goes a long way, too much delight ruins the fun._
